In the post pandemic era we all are becoming health conscious. People are always 
afraid of any disease if they seem any symptoms in themselves. These symptoms 
might be silly or very serious, but everybody has not the knowledge of the possible 
disease and to take the right decision of whether they need a doctor to consult or 
not, if yes, then the best preference according to their problem. So, with the help of 
machine learning we have sorted out this real-life problem considering the previous 
works done in this specific subject with a little bit added features from our side.
